# Team7 - Project 1: Traffic Sign Detection/Recognition

This is our code for the first project. 

## Requirements
 
The file ```requirements.txt``` contains all the required packages to run our code. This project has been developed in Python
3.7.

To run our code simply run the ``` traffic_sign_model.py ``` script. These are the optional arguments:


*  ```-images_dir IMAGES_DIR```        Directory with input images and annotations. Default: ```./train/```
*  ```-output_dir OUTPUT_DIR``` Directory where to store output masks, etc. Default: ```./results/```
*  ```-test_dir TEST_DIR``` Directory with the test split images. Default: ```./test/```
*  ```-pixelMethod PIXELMETHOD``` Colour space used during the segmentation(either hsv or normrgb). Default: ```hsv```
*  ```-windowMethod WINDOWMETHOD``` Window method. Default: ```None```

If you want to use the default arguments just put the ```train``` and the ```test``` directories in the root directory
of this project and run the script.
